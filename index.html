        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Olaniyi Olufemi. I love­ creating graphics and am always curious about tech. After spe­nding a lot of time turning ideas into pictures, I now want to link art and te­chnology. I plan to achieve this by becoming a front-e­nd engineer..</p>

        <h2>Reasons for Joining Altschool.com</h2>
        <p>
            There are several compelling reasons why I decided to join altschool.com to learn front-end engineering:
        </p>

        <p><strong>Positive Reviews and Success Stories:</strong>Positive reviews and success stories from past learners who have excelled in their front-end engineering careers after completing the program at altschool.com played a significant role in my decision. Knowing that others have achieved success through this platform instills confidence in its effectiveness.</p>

        <p><strong>Community Support:</strong> Being part of a community of learners is essential for motivation and collaboration. Altschool.com provides a supportive online community where I can connect with fellow learners, share experiences, and seek help when needed.</p>

        <p><strong>Learning Pace</strong> The idea that i would be able to learn at my own pace, which was the idea i was sold, as a full time job and schooling at the same time is no easy task expecially in the country where you could spend your nights in traffic just trying to get home.</p>

        <p><strong>Structure</strong> Looking for somethig with a bit more structure as just going via youtube and other online materials might not help in learning from the ground up.</p>

    <section id="What i plan to achieve at altschool">
        <h2>What i plan to achieve at Altschool</h2>
        <p>
            I'm set on maste­ring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and using tools like React for creating inte­ractive, responsive we­bsites. My plan is to apply what I learn in projects, sharpe­ning my problem-solving skills in the process. I'll also count on the­ online community for swapping knowledge, and le­arn from, the insights of industry pros. My goal? To not only land a front-end deve­lopment job, but to bring fresh ideas to the­ ever-changing world of tech.
